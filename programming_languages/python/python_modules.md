        - sometimes very handy for student papers to all be in the same format
    - pip install docx2txt
    - [see this script](useful_scripts/docx_to_txt.py) for an implementation that takes all docx files in the local folder and converts them to txt files

    ```python
    text = docx2txt.process(file)
    ```
