## Languages included here

### [Julia](https://julialang.org/)

Julia is a high level JIT compiled language which allows for python like syntax (i.e. easy to read and learn) but with a bit of tweaking similar speeds to complied languages such as C or C++.

- [Julia useful commands and code](programming_languages/julia/julia_useful_commands.md)

### [dotnet](https://dotnetfoundation.org/)

.Net Standard (I'll just use dotnet for ease of use and understanding) is the platform for the majority of Microsoft's official development languages and tools. It includes powershell, c#, f# and others. I primarily use it for powershell and c#. I use c# specifically to do anything that is slow in python since c# is a complied language.

### [Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)

This is github flavored markdown but most of it transfers seamlessly to other flavors of markdown

- [Useful resources](programming_languages/markdown/markdown_resources.md)

### [Python](https://www.python.org/)

Python is a general purpose scripting language that because of its popularity has many other frameworks with Python wrapper code to allow for use in Python.

- [Useful packages](programming_languages/R/r_useful_packages.md)

### [RegEx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)

RegEx (regular expression) is used to match text once you learn a little bit of it it is very useful.
