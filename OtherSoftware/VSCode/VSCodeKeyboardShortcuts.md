### Extension Based Shortcuts (Windows)

VS Code shortcuts that are not associated with any extensions. Some of these shortcuts have been modified by me and I use them with settings sync to make them consistent across computers.

| Shortcut I Use | Description                                    | Original Shortcut        | Extension Name    | Command                                | Further explanation                                               |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "ctrl+shift+c" | Copy the selection without syntax highlighting | N/A                      | copy-text         | copy-text.copyTextOnly                 | [Repository](https://github.com/s-albert/copy-text)               |
