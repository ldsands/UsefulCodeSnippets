- The screen command allows you to have multiple shells open through one SSH connection. This is very useful for the HPC on campus that I use frequently. More instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.uiowa.edu/display/hpcdocs/Tips+for+Reducing+the+Number+of+Duo+Two-Factor+Logins#TipsforReducingtheNumberofDuoTwoFactorLogins-ProgramstoReduceSSHLogins:~:text=application.)-,Programs%20to%20Reduce%20SSH%20Logins). A few handy commands are shown below:

    ```sh
    # list the screens being used
    screen -ls
    ```
