# PDF-XChange Editor

This is my preferred PDF reading and editing program. I have searched for years and finally found this program. Nothing else has come close for me.

The changelog is located [here](https://www.tracker-software.com/product/pdf-xchange-editor/history)

## My Preferred Settings

- Under preferences
    - Documents tab:
        - Enable: "Restore Last Session when application starts"
        - Disable: "Back/Forward commands navigate through all opened documents"
    - Tools tab:
        - Default Tool: "Select Tool"

## Usage Tips and Tricks

### Searching Tips

- Find can be brought up using `ctrl+f` this will search for the characters/words within the current document
    - There are several options, sometimes I will use the highlight option so that all of the results are highlighted
- Search can be brought up using `ctrl+shift+f` this will do a search for the characters/words but it has many additional options
    - Under "WHERE would you like to search" you can select "In All Open Documents"
    - Under "Options..." you can specify the "Proximity" which I use to find two words that may be with in the same paragraph or the same page, I use this a lot
- Under "Options" you can select "Colored Search Results" to highlight all of the different words from the most recent search in different colors

### PDF Conversion and Enhancement

- When using the OCR function I set these preferences:
    - Under the "Recognition Options" section:
        - Set "Accuracy" to "High"
        - I enable all of the other options in this section
    - Under the "Output Options" section:
        - Set "Type" to "Searchable Image"
        - Enable "Fix content skew and incorrect page rotation"
        - Disable "Create a New Document"

### Random Tips

- Using the `alt+left` will take you to the last place you clicked or searched in the document and the `alt+right` will then take you forward again
