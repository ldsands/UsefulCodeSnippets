## Kubunbu Installation

- If you're dual booting Linux can cause issues with the time setting on Windows. The easiest way to deal with this is by using this command in Linux: `timedatectl set-local-rtc 1 --adjust-system-clock` this tells Linux that the motherboard time is in local time. To check if it worked enter `timedatectl` into ther terminal and if "RTC in local TZ:" is yes then there won't be an issue with the time settings on Windows.
